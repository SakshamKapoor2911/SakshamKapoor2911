# Hi, I‚Äôm Saksham Kapoor üëã

## üéì About Me
[cite_start]I‚Äôm a Computer Science and Machine Learning student at the University of Maryland passionate about architecting and building intelligent, scalable systems. [cite: 1] I'm driven by the challenge of solving complex, real-world problems with code, which I explore through my projects in AI, distributed systems, and performance optimization. [cite_start]As the Vice President of BigThink AI, I also enjoy leading workshops and sharing my knowledge with the tech community. [cite: 3]

## üõ†Ô∏è What I‚Äôm Working On
- [cite_start]**Building Resilient AI Systems:** Architecting a fault-tolerant, high-throughput medical diagnostics platform using a microservices architecture in Go, Kubernetes, and the Raft consensus algorithm. [cite: 9]
- [cite_start]**Developing Advanced AI Agents:** Creating multi-agent systems with AWS Bedrock and building autonomous research agents that leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for dynamic, fact-based reasoning. [cite: 7]
- [cite_start]**Optimizing Model Performance:** Fine-tuning LLMs with advanced RL techniques like GRPO and engineering high-performance computer vision pipelines for video analysis, achieving up to a 9x performance increase. [cite: 4, 8]
