# Hi, I‚Äôm Saksham Kapoor üëã

## üéì About Me
I‚Äôm a Computer Science and Machine Learning student at the University of Maryland, passionate about architecting and building intelligent, scalable systems.  I'm driven by the challenge of solving complex, real-world problems with code, which I explore through my projects in AI, distributed systems, and performance optimization. As the Vice President of BigThink AI, I also enjoy leading workshops and sharing my knowledge with the tech community. I'm also engaged in several concurrent research projects in Computer Vision, MultiModal ASR + Sentiment Analysis, and Circuit Stability + Mechanistic Interpretability. Stay posted for updates!

## üõ†Ô∏è What I‚Äôm Working On
- **Building Resilient AI Systems:** Architecting a fault-tolerant, high-throughput medical diagnostics platform using a microservices architecture in Go, Kubernetes, and the Raft consensus algorithm. 
- **Developing Advanced AI Agents:** Creating multi-agent systems with AWS Bedrock and building autonomous research agents that leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for dynamic, fact-based reasoning. 
- **Optimizing Model Performance:** Fine-tuning LLMs with advanced RL techniques like GRPO and engineering high-performance computer vision pipelines for video analysis, achieving up to a 9x performance increase.

## üöÄ Featured Projects

| Project | Description | Key Technologies |
|---|---|---|
| [**MedInsight: AI-Powered Medical Diagnostics**](https://github.com/SakshamKapoor2911/Full_stack_Medical_Diagnostics) | Architected a polyglot microservices platform with a high-performance Go API gateway and a Python AI service, orchestrated on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). Designed a decoupled system using Google Pub/Sub for fault tolerance and self-hosted Google's Gemma 2 to ensure HIPAA-ready data privacy. | `Go`, `Python`, `GKE`, `Pub/Sub`, `Docker`, `Gemma 2` |
| [**AuraFlow: Enterprise Supply Chain Intelligence**](https://github.com/SakshamKapoor2911/AuraFlow) | Architected a cloud-native, event-driven microservices system in Java (Spring Boot) on AWS, benchmarking at 40,000 events/min. Guaranteed data consistency across 5 microservices by implementing the Saga pattern with AWS SQS. | `Java`, `Spring Boot`, `AWS`, `Microservices`, `SQS`, `DynamoDB` |
| [**AzureDev Nexus: Intelligent Developer Ecosystem**](https://github.com/SakshamKapoor2911/AzureDevNexus) | Developed a production-ready, enterprise-grade platform in the .NET ecosystem, featuring an AI-powered code reviewer using Azure OpenAI and a real-time collaboration platform with SignalR. | `C#`, `.NET`, `Blazor`, `Azure OpenAI`, `SignalR` |
| [**Connect Verse: Real-Time Social Metaverse**](https://github.com/SakshamKapoor2911/ConnectVerse) | Engineered a mobile-first, real-time social app with a Node.js backend managing thousands of concurrent WebSocket connections. Implemented a Redis caching layer to significantly reduce PostgreSQL database load and improve user experience. | `React Native`, `Node.js`, `WebSocket`, `Redis`, `PostgreSQL` |
| [**Multi-Agent Pet Store on AWS**](https://github.com/SakshamKapoor2911/AgenticAI_with_AWS_Bedrock) | Architected a multi-agent system using AWS Bedrock Agents, projected to cut customer service response time by over 90%. Designed a text-to-SQL pipeline with a self-correcting agent loop for natural language database interaction. | `AWS Bedrock`, `Lambda`, `OpenSearch`, `RDS` |
| [**Autonomous Deep Research Agent**](https://github.com/SakshamKapoor2911/Autonomous-Research-Agent) | Developed an agent that autonomously decomposes a high-level query into a multi-level question hierarchy and implements a RAG pipeline using Milvus to synthesize findings into a detailed report. | `Python`, `LangChain`, `Milvus`, `Wikipedia API` |
| [**LLM Fine-Tuning with GRPO**](https://github.com/SakshamKapoor2911/GRPO-Finetuning-LLMs) | Fine-tuned Microsoft's Phi 14B model for mathematical reasoning on the GSM8K dataset. Implemented the GRPO algorithm with custom reward functions to improve complex reasoning. | `PyTorch`, `TRL`, `Unsloth`, `Hugging Face` |
