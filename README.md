# Hi, I'm Saksham Kapoor 👋

## 🎓 About Me

I'm a Computer Science and Machine Learning student at the University of Maryland, passionate about architecting and building intelligent, scalable systems. I'm driven by the challenge of solving complex, real-world problems with code, which I explore through my projects in AI, distributed systems, and performance optimization. As the Vice President of BigThink AI, I also enjoy leading workshops and sharing my knowledge with the tech community. I'm also engaged in several concurrent research projects in Computer Vision, MultiModal ASR + Sentiment Analysis, and Circuit Stability + Mechanistic Interpretability. Stay posted for updates!

## 🛠️ What I'm Working On

- **Building Resilient AI Systems:** Exploring fault-tolerant, high-throughput architectures using microservices, Go, Kubernetes, and distributed consensus algorithms.
- **Developing Advanced AI Agents:** Creating multi-agent systems and autonomous research agents that leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for dynamic, fact-based reasoning.
- **Engineering High-Throughput ML:** Researching graph-aware anomaly detection approaches and exploring optimizations in time-series analysis and machine learning inference.
