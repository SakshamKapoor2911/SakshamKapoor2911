# Hi, I‚Äôm Saksham Kapoor üëã

## üéì About Me
I‚Äôm a Computer Science and Machine Learning student at the University of Maryland, passionate about architecting and building intelligent, scalable systems.  I'm driven by the challenge of solving complex, real-world problems with code, which I explore through my projects in AI, distributed systems, and performance optimization. As the Vice President of BigThink AI, I also enjoy leading workshops and sharing my knowledge with the tech community. I'm also engaged in several concurrent research projects in Computer Vision, MultiModal ASR + Sentiment Analysis, and Circuit Stability + Mechanistic Interpretability. Stay posted for updates!

## üõ†Ô∏è What I‚Äôm Working On
- **Building Resilient AI Systems:** Architecting a fault-tolerant, high-throughput medical diagnostics platform using a microservices architecture in Go, Kubernetes, and the Raft consensus algorithm. 
- **Developing Advanced AI Agents:** Creating multi-agent systems with AWS Bedrock and building autonomous research agents that leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for dynamic, fact-based reasoning. 
- **Optimizing Model Performance:** Fine-tuning LLMs with advanced RL techniques like GRPO and engineering high-performance computer vision pipelines for video analysis, achieving up to a 9x performance increase.

## üöÄ Featured Projects

| Project | Description | Key Technologies |
|---|---|---|
| [**Scalable Multi-Agent Diagnostic System**](https://github.com/SakshamKapoor2911/Full_stack_Medical_Diagnostics) | Architecting a fault-tolerant, distributed system in Go to evolve a Python prototype into a scalable microservices architecture. The core AI agent achieved **92% diagnostic accuracy** against a medical expert's evaluation. | `Go`, `Python`, `Kubernetes`, `Raft`, `LangGraph`, `Gemini` |
| [**Multi-Agent Pet Store on AWS**](https://github.com/SakshamKapoor2911/AgenticAI_with_AWS_Bedrock) | Architected a multi-agent system using AWS Bedrock Agents, projected to cut customer service response time by over 90%. Designed a text-to-SQL pipeline with a self-correcting agent loop for natural language database interaction. | `AWS Bedrock`, `Lambda`, `OpenSearch`, `RDS` |
| [**Autonomous Deep Research Agent**](https://github.com/SakshamKapoor2911/Autonomous-Research-Agent) | Developed an agent that autonomously decomposes a high-level query into a multi-level question hierarchy and implements a RAG pipeline using Milvus to synthesize findings into a detailed report. | `Python`, `LangChain`, `Milvus`, `Wikipedia API` |
| [**LLM Fine-Tuning with GRPO**](https://github.com/SakshamKapoor2911/GRPO-Finetuning-LLMs) | Fine-tuned Microsoft's Phi 14B model for mathematical reasoning on the GSM8K dataset. Implemented the GRPO algorithm with custom reward functions to improve complex reasoning. | `PyTorch`, `TRL`, `Unsloth`, `Hugging Face` |                                                                  | `PyTorch`, `TRL`, `Unsloth`, `Hugging Face`                                        |
