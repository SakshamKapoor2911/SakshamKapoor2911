## Hi there üëã
Hi, I‚Äôm Saksham Kapoor üëã
üéì About Me
I‚Äôm a Computer Science and Machine Learning student at the University of Maryland passionate about architecting and building intelligent, scalable systems. I'm driven by the challenge of solving complex, real-world problems with code, which I explore through my projects in AI, distributed systems, and performance optimization. As the Vice President of BigThink AI, I also enjoy leading workshops and sharing my knowledge with the tech community.

üõ†Ô∏è What I‚Äôm Working On
Building Resilient AI Systems: Architecting a fault-tolerant, high-throughput medical diagnostics platform using a microservices architecture in Go, Kubernetes, and the Raft consensus algorithm.

Developing Advanced AI Agents: Creating multi-agent systems with AWS Bedrock and building autonomous research agents that leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for dynamic, fact-based reasoning.

Optimizing Model Performance: Fine-tuning large language models with advanced RL techniques like GRPO and engineering high-performance computer vision pipelines for video analysis, achieving up to a 9x performance increase.

Description

Key Technologies

Full_stack_Medical_Diagnostics

A scalable, AI-powered medical diagnostics platform featuring a sophisticated AI agent with 92% diagnostic accuracy. I am currently re-architecting this full-stack application into a resilient, distributed system using a microservices architecture to handle high-concurrency workloads.

Go, Python, Kubernetes, Docker, LangGraph, Next.js, TypeScript, Raft Consensus

AgenticAI_with_AWS_Bedrock

An agentic AI application built on AWS Bedrock that automates workflows for a retail business. This system features multiple specialized agents for task orchestration, knowledge base interaction, and database management, including a novel query correction agent to improve the accuracy of text-to-SQL operations.

AWS Bedrock, Lambda, S3, OpenSearch, Aurora RDS, Python, Streamlit

Autonomous-Research-Agent

An autonomous research agent that deconstructs complex questions, builds a dynamic knowledge base using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, and synthesizes the findings into a structured report. This project showcases an end-to-end agentic workflow, from planning and tool use to final content generation.

LangChain, Hugging Face, Milvus, Sentence-Transformers, Unsloth, Python

GRPO-Finetuning-LLMs

Fine-tuned Microsoft's Phi 14B model for advanced mathematical reasoning using Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). I engineered custom reward functions and leveraged PEFT with LoRA for memory-efficient training, resulting in a model with significantly improved multi-step reasoning abilities.

PyTorch, TRL, Hugging Face Transformers, Unsloth, LoRA, vLLM, BitsAndBytes
