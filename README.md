# Hi, I’m Saksham Kapoor 👋

## 🎓 About Me
I’m a Computer Science and Machine Learning student at the University of Maryland, passionate about architecting and building intelligent, scalable systems.  I'm driven by the challenge of solving complex, real-world problems with code, which I explore through my projects in AI, distributed systems, and performance optimization. As the Vice President of BigThink AI, I also enjoy leading workshops and sharing my knowledge with the tech community. I'm also engaged in several concurrent research projects in Computer Vision, MultiModal ASR + Sentiment Analysis, and Circuit Stability + Mechanistic Interpretability. Stay posted for updates!

## 🛠️ What I’m Working On
- **Building Resilient AI Systems:** Architecting a fault-tolerant, high-throughput medical diagnostics platform using a microservices architecture in Go, Kubernetes, and the Raft consensus algorithm. 
- **Developing Advanced AI Agents:** Creating multi-agent systems with AWS Bedrock and building autonomous research agents that leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for dynamic, fact-based reasoning. 
- **Engineering High-Throughput ML:** Architecting graph-aware anomaly detection engines that solve non-stationarity in production. Recently achieved a **73x accuracy lift** and **1.2M events/sec throughput** (0.80 μs latency) by optimizing CPU memory layouts for XGBoost.
